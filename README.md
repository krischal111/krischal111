### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

It's me, Krischal Khanal.




IT skills I'm confident about:
1. Markdown:
    - I use markdown for almost all of my notetaking in IT field.
    - I routinely use $\KaTeX$ and <b style="font-family:Tahoma; color:white; border: 2px solid green; border-radius:20px; padding:5px; margin:5px; background-color:brown;">HTML/CSS</b> for prettifying the output.

2. $\LaTeX$: I make use of latex for various high quality note taking and report making.

1. Programming Paradigms:
    - I use different programming paradigms to solve the problems at hand.
        1. Object-oriented
        2. Procedure-oriented
        3. Functional approach
1. Competitive Coding:
    1. I am proficient in various skills and techniques utilized in the competitive coding like:
        1. DSA:
            1. Tree:
                1. In-Order Pre-Order and Post-Order Traversal
            2. Graphs and Tree:
                1. DFS and BFS
            3. Graphs:
                1. Dijkstra's Algorithm
            4. Array:
                1. Various sorting algorithms
                2. Binary, and linear searching
            2. Stacks and Queue
            3. MinHeap and MaxHeap
            4. HashMap and HashSets
        2. Techniques:
            1. Sliding window for arrays
            2. Dynamic Programming
            4. Greedy Algorithms
            3. Recursions

1. Rust
    1. I solve a lot of problems in CP using Rust.
    2. I contributed to a starter code for a competition. [Here](https://github.com/krischal111/smartbots-2023-starter-code/tree/master/rust)
    3. I've made small interesting things in rust here:
    [Re-write in Rust: Advanced Implementations](https://github.com/krischal111/rust-advanced-implementations)

2. Python
    1. Numpy
    2. matplotlib
    3. And bits of:
        1. Scikit Learn
        2. Pandas
    - I solve many CP problems using python3.

2. C/C++:
    1. [Snake Game in C](https://github.com/krischal111/Snake-Game-C-Project)
        - I made a snake game for the first year C project with my teammates. 
        - This was the first large C/C++ project for me.
        - We added artificial intelligence like in Qbasic's version I made a while back.
        - Sound effects
        - Storage of records
    2. [Reversi Game in C++](https://github.com/krischal111/Reversi-game-cpp-project)
        - I also made a Reversi game in for the second semester C++ project.
        - It took 3 full days of work.
        - It was the largest C++ project worked all by myself.
    3. [Ray Tracing in C++](https://github.com/krischal111/Ray_Tracing/tree/master)
        - We made this implementation of the ray-tracing for the Graphics as well as DSA project for the fourth semester.
        - Graphics
            - Rendering a 3d scene into a 2d image (ppm file) using ray tracing.
        - DSA
            - Use of Binary Tree called BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy).
            - It reduced time complexity of $O(n)$ to $O(\log n)$.
        - We made a lot of use of Object Oriented Programming by exploiting the use of inheritance and polymorphism.

3. QBASIC (QB64):
    1. [Snake Game in QBASIC](https://github.com/krischal111/Snake-Game-Qb64)
        - Before I started my highschool, I made a snake game. I poured so much attention to the detail and effort to this game. It took more more than a week.
        - Works using mouse as well as keyboard.
        - Added activation system to limit free access to my hard work, later removed.
        - Added artificial intelligence mode.
        - Added sound effects.
        - Added storage of high scores records.

    - I also made a sokobon game. I have it in my google drive.
        - You can play through classic 15 levels of the game.
        - I also made a separate app used to make and edit the levels.
        - I also added a separate program to auto-solving each levels.

4. Use of Rest API's

5. SQL

6. Octave/MatLab


Skill in Electronics Engineering:
1. Arduino
2. L293D
3. MosFETs
